              I originally conceptuaized this video for “Sugar Life” “Sugar Shxt” but the more i got into the ideas the more i realized that this treatment completely encapsulates not only the sugar trap brand but also Rico herself…
            </p>
            <p>
              The video concept is just her getting pampered @ the Mansion and subtly revolves around the continued idea from her last visual “Sugar Trap 2” that she has super powers and special abilities (all woman are super heroes ) with each shot showcasing one of her “powers”. The focus is taking the the most relatable and iconic aspects of womanly life and exaggerating them to the dopest level

              Animated tacobella character astral projecting into someones dream flying to the crib with exposition shots of the environment.(shot will be created using drone) climbing into ricos ear then she wakes up
            </p>

              Starts with an Over the bed shot of her just waking up pupils dilating very dynamic closeup. Possibly another shot of her leaning forward and lighting a joint. As she gets up its revealed that her hair is 100 feet long and she has a leathered man holding the hair on some crazy cleopatra boss bitch vibes Then followed by exposition shots of the environment (i.e the bedroom and and the staircase leading to the living room)

              The video continues with Rico going into the living room where an older lady (of asian descent) is waiting there to do her acryllics. Its in this shot that the first super power is showcased TITANIUM NAILS!!! we’ll probably shoot real sparks from a real grinder and get some spark vfx
            </p>

              Rico leaves acryllic station to go get in the bathtub( b-roll of her running through the house blowing smoke maybe she slices something with her nails otw etc.)
            </p>

              Bath tub scene is very vibey as far as lighting
              In this scene we’ll highlight the magic of skincare and cosmetics. A bath bomb that contains the universe and all kinds of dope shit.

            <p>These shots will be very symmetrical will have lights on a timer and when rico interacts with the bath bomb light will sync to beat (would also like to create a diamond bubble soap dispenser kind of off aesthetic but still dope)</p>
